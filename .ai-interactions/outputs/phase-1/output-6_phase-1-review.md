# Keen CLI — Phase 1 Progress Evaluation

## Build & Test Status

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `go build ./...` | ✅ Passes |
| `go test ./...` | ✅ Passes (config, filesystem) |

---

## Task-by-Task Assessment

### Task 1: Project Structure & Go Module ✅ Complete

| Planned | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `cmd/agent/main.go` | ✅ Present | Done |
| `internal/config/` | ✅ Present (config.go, loader.go) | Done |
| `internal/filesystem/` | ✅ Present (guard.go, gitawareness.go) | Done |
| `internal/cli/` | ✅ Present (root.go, repl.go, setup.go) | Done |
| `configs/system_prompts/` | ⚠️ Directory exists, empty | Minimal |
| `go.mod` with deps | ✅ cobra, yaml.v3, go-git, huh | Done |

**Actual structure** matches the plan closely. The addition of `configs/providers/` (registry) is a welcome bonus not in the original phase 1 plan but specified in the later CLI design doc.

---

### Task 2: Config System ✅ Complete

**Design doc:** [output-4_config-design.md](file:///Users/mchowdhury2/stuff/ai/keen-cli/.ai-interactions/outputs/phase-1/output-4_config-design.md)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `GlobalConfig` struct (JSON) | ✅ | `active_provider`, `active_model`, `providers` map |
| `ProviderConfig` struct | ✅ | `models []string`, `api_key string` |
| `SessionConfig` struct | ✅ | In-memory only, no persistence |
| `ResolvedConfig` struct | ✅ | Final merged config |
| `Resolve()` function | ✅ | Session > Global > Default resolution |
| `Loader` (Load/Save/Exists) | ✅ | JSON persistence to `~/.keen/configs.json` |
| `GetProviderConfig()` | ✅ | |
| `SetProviderConfig()` | ✅ | |
| `AddModel()` | ✅ | Dedup logic included |
| `GetFirstModel()` | ✅ | |
| `ConfigPath()` / `ConfigDir()` | ✅ | |
| 0600 file permissions | ✅ | In `loader.go` Save() |
| Unit tests | ✅ | 13 tests across `config_test.go` and `loader_test.go` |

> [!TIP]
> The config system is one of the most complete parts of the codebase — fully matching the design doc with good test coverage.

**Minor deviation:** The design doc has `SetProviderConfig` returning an error, but the implementation is `void` (no error return). The current implementation silently initializes the map if nil, which is fine.

---

### Task 3: FileGuard ✅ Complete

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `Permission` type (Denied/Granted/Pending) | ✅ | Enum with iota |
| `Guard` struct | ✅ | workingDir, blockedPaths, gitignore |
| `NewGuard()` constructor | ✅ | Injects working dir + GitAwareness |
| `CheckPath()` permission matrix | ✅ | read+inDir=Granted, write=Pending, outside=Pending |
| `IsBlocked()` | ✅ | Checks gitignore + sensitive paths + dotfiles |
| `ResolvePath()` | ✅ | Handles relative and absolute paths |
| `IsInWorkingDir()` | ✅ | |
| Blocked paths list | ✅ | `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, etc. |
| Dotfile protection | ✅ | Blocks `~/.<anything>` |
| Unit tests | ✅ | 8 test functions |

**Deviation from plan:** The plan specified blocking path traversal (`../`) as `PermissionDenied`, but the implementation treats it as `PermissionPending` (asks user). The test explicitly documents this choice. This is arguably more flexible — the user can approve access to sibling directories.

> [!NOTE]
> The plan listed `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws` as explicitly blocked sensitive paths. The implementation takes a broader approach: **any** path starting with `~/.<something>` is blocked. This is stricter than the plan and a reasonable security choice.

---

### Task 4: GitAwareness ✅ Complete

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `GitAwareness` struct | ✅ | Uses `go-git` gitignore package |
| `LoadGitignore()` | ✅ | Parses single `.gitignore` file |
| `LoadGitignoreRecursive()` | ✅ | Walks directories for nested `.gitignore` |
| `IsIgnored()` | ✅ | Checks all loaded patterns |
| `FilterPaths()` | ✅ | Batch filter operation |
| Comments & blank lines | ✅ | Handled in parser |
| Glob patterns | ✅ | Via `go-git` library |
| Unit tests | ✅ | 5 test functions including recursive loading |

**What's missing from the plan:**
- ❌ **Global gitignore** (`~/.gitignore_global`) — not implemented
- ❌ **Caching** of `IsIgnored` results — no cache layer
- ❌ **Negation patterns** (`!important.log`) — no test for this (the library may support it, but it's untested)
- ❌ **Interface extraction** — the plan specifies `GitAwareness` as an interface, but the implementation is a concrete struct. `Guard` depends on `*GitAwareness` directly, not an interface.

---

### Task 5: Basic CLI ✅ Complete

**Design doc:** [output-5_basic-cli.md](file:///Users/mchowdhury2/stuff/ai/keen-cli/.ai-interactions/outputs/phase-1/output-5_basic-cli.md)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `keen` starts REPL | ✅ | Root command runs REPL |
| `keen --version` | ✅ | Via cobra's built-in version |
| Interactive setup (first run) | ✅ | Provider → API Key → Model flow |
| Provider registry (embedded YAML) | ✅ | `configs/providers/registry.yaml` |
| `huh` for interactive prompts | ✅ | Select + password input |
| Config saved after setup | ✅ | To `~/.keen/configs.json` |
| REPL with styled output | ✅ | lipgloss styling, welcome banner |
| Signal handling (Ctrl+C) | ✅ | Graceful shutdown |
| `/exit` command | ✅ | |
| No CLI flags (all via prompts) | ✅ | |

**The REPL stub:**
The REPL currently **echoes input** back — it has no command routing, no `/help`, `/plan`, `/work`, `/model`, `/clear`, or `/add` commands. This is expected for a phase 1 stub.

**No tests for CLI/setup/providers:**
```
? github.com/user/keen-cli/cmd/agent       [no test files]
? github.com/user/keen-cli/configs/providers [no test files]
? github.com/user/keen-cli/internal/cli      [no test files]
```

---

### Task 6: Structured Logging ✅ Complete

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `log/slog` usage | ✅ | Standard library structured logging |
| Log level config | ✅ | Via `KEEN_LOG_LEVEL` env var |
| Logging in components | ✅ | Used in config loader, guard, config resolution |

**Deviation:** The plan mentioned a dedicated `internal/logger/` package. Instead, logging is configured directly in `main.go` using `slog.SetDefault()`. This is simpler and perfectly fine for the current stage.

---

## Overall Scorecard

| Task | Plan Status | Quality | Tests |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 1. Project Structure | ✅ Complete | Good | N/A |
| 2. Config System | ✅ Complete | Strong | 13 tests ✅ |
| 3. FileGuard | ✅ Complete | Strong | 8 tests ✅ |
| 4. GitAwareness | ⚠️ Mostly Complete | Good (missing interface, cache, global gitignore) | 5 tests ✅ |
| 5. Basic CLI | ✅ Complete | Good | ❌ No tests |
| 6. Logging | ✅ Complete | Simple but effective | N/A |

---

## Summary

**Phase 1 is ~90% complete.** All six tasks have working implementations. The project builds, tests pass, and the binary runs. The remaining gaps are:

1. **GitAwareness interface** — not extracted (breaks RFC design)
2. **No caching** in GitAwareness (plan specified it)
3. **No global gitignore** support
4. **No tests** for `internal/cli/`, `configs/providers/`, or `cmd/agent/`
5. **`prompt.go` deletion** — mentioned in the basic CLI plan as something to remove, but it doesn't exist (already done or never created)
6. **REPL is a stub** — only echoes input, no command routing (expected for phase 1)

The code quality is clean, idiomatic Go. No comments clutter the code. Dependencies are minimal and well-chosen. The security model (FileGuard + GitAwareness integration) is solid.
